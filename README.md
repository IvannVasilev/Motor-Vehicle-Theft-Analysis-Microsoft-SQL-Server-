# 🚗 Motor Vehicle Theft Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project explores a dataset of motor vehicle thefts to identify patterns across time, geography, and vehicle characteristics. By using Microsoft SQL Server, I've transformed raw data into insights regarding high-risk regions and popular vehicle targets.

## Key Questions Answered
1.  **Temporal Trends:** Which days of the week and months see the highest theft rates?
2.  **Vehicle Profiles:** What are the most frequently stolen vehicle types and their average ages?
3.  **Regional Impact:** How does population density correlate with theft volume?
4.  **Luxury vs. Standard:** What percentage of stolen vehicles are classified as "Luxury"?

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Data Aggregation:** Using `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG`.
* **Date Functions:** Extracting `YEAR`, `MONTH`, and `DATEPART`.
* **Advanced Logic:** Implementing `CASE` statements and `CTEs`.
* **Table Joins:** Combining `stolen_vehicles`, `locations`, and `make_details`.

## Summary of Findings
* **Color Correlation:** Silver and White are the most common colors among stolen vehicles.
* **High-Risk Regions:** Theft volume was compared across high-density regions like Auckland and Wellington versus lower-density areas.
